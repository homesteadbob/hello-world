# hello-world
  Tecnology has come along way since the commodore 64, so far in fact that I have totaly lost tract of any programing skills I had.
I blame Windows and Bill Gates. <br><br>I wonder where I could have been now, at the age of 52, if I had not be lured in by windows. 
Instead , learning all the programming skills that have come along since then. <br><br>Would I have been a programmer, A pc repair man, have an IT job? The list goes on and on. <br>
No, instead I chose the easy route and let Bill Gates take all the wnder of discovery away from me.<br><br>
You robbed me of a promising futhure Bill Gates! A nice fat check would help ease the pain of loss and suffering. <br><br>Call me.
